# 9-Line-Card-Generator
A small C# Application to create/save 9-Line Cards.
Right now, it createss .txt files with a simple format, each 'line' of the 9-line card (hereafter refured to as 9lLine) is stored as a serpate line in the text file.
I will be adding either an excel macro to import this in 9-line format, or a C# solution to create an excel file/PDF in 9-Line format.
